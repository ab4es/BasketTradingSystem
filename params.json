{"name":"Interactive Brokers Automated Basket Trading System","tagline":"","body":"# BasketTradingSystem\r\nBasket Trading System to be used with Interactive Brokers' Trade Workstation.\r\n\r\nThis system provides the user a simple GUI in which he can upload a formatted CSV file with his Basket Order so that it can be transmitted using the Interactive Brokers' TWS. This Basket Order System differs from the BasketTrader offered within IB's TWS in that it runs a custom strategy that serves as an automated basket trading system that leverages the relative bid-ask spread sizes of a basketâ€™s positions so as to shave the spread costs on these financial instruments, especially those that are particularly liquid.\r\n\r\nDeveloped during Summer 2015 by <a href = \"mailto:ab4es@virginia.edu\">Aditya Bindra</a> - Quantitative Developer at Constantia Capital.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
